# Decrypt ncm file


## Try it!

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/TENX-S/Crack_ncm && cd Crack_ncm
$ cargo run --release /absolute/path/to/your/ncm/files
```


## Tips:

It's not quite stable for now, some converted files(.flac/.mp3) may have a very short interruption (< 1 sec).

But it's hard to happen:)
